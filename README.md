Modak can be shaped in many ways. You can make them with the fluted petal shape or even in the shape of half-moon similar to karanji or gujia.

To give the fluted shape with hands some practice and experience is required. I prefer to use modak moulds as I find shaping with them is quicker than shaping with hands.

Many shops begin to sell the modak moulds before Ganesh Chaturthi festival. You can even buy them online. If you are beginners then you can make the half-moon shape for modak or buy the moulds.
